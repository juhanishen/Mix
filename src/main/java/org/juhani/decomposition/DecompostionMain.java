/**
 * Given an Integer, for example, 11. A decompostion means sum of integer equal to the given
 * number. For example, give by 11, a couple of decompostion is as follows:
 *  11 = 1+10;
 *  11 = 11;
 *  11= 1+3+7;
 *  11=2+8+1;
 *  11 = 5+6;
 *    …
 * An order decompostion means all integer which sums equal to given number is odd number. 
 * For example, 
 *  11 = 1+3+7
 *  11 = 11;
 *  is two odd decompostion. The maximum number of integer is called maixmum odd decompostion.
 *  For example, 11=1+3+7 is maximum odd decompostion since it has 3 integers. 
 *  You are suppose to write a program as follows public int[] solution(int N), to return the 
 *  maximum odd decompostion. There could be several possible maximum odd decompostion, one only
 *  need to return one of them.
